``exp.json`` is your go-to place for configuring parts of your app that don't belong in code. The following is a full list of properties available to you.

 A short description of what your app is and why it is great.

.. attribute:: slug

 **Required**. The friendly url name for publishing. eg: ``exp.host/@your-username/slug``.

 Your app version, use whatever versioning scheme that you like.

.. attribute:: orientation

 Lock your app to a specific orientation with ``portrait`` or ``landscape``. Defaults to no lock.
 default, portrait, landscape

 A url that points to your app's icon image. We recommend that you use a 512x512 png file with transparency. This icon will appear on the home screen and within the Exponent app.
