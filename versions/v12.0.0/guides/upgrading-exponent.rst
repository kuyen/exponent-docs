******************
Upgrading Exponent
******************

It isn't strictly necessary to update your app when a new version of Exponent
is released.  New versions of the Exponent client are backwards compatible
with apps published for previous versions for at least one year. This means
that you can download a new version of the Exponent client and open apps that
were published for previous versions and they will work perfectly.

That said, each version is better than the last, so you might want to stay up
to date to take advantage of new features and performance improvements.

**Upgrade guides vary depending on the sdkVersion, so follow the guide in the release notes**

We post our release notes to `The Exponent Log <https://blog.getexponent.com/>`_, for example the `v8.0.0 release notes <https://blog.getexponent.com/exponent-sdk-v8-0-0-is-available-581255a279b1#.iw6pjhknl>`_. If you're upgrading by more than one major version, we recommend following the upgrade guide for each major version between your current version and your target.
